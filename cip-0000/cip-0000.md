# Canton Improvement Proposal (CIP) Process

Canton Improvement Proposals for the Global Synchronizer on Canton Network (CIPs) define new operating procedures for the Global Synchronizer, including control of Super Validator rights, governance both on-chain and off-chain, and design specifications for new features for the Splice and Canton software operated by Super Validator and Validator nodes. CIPs may propose changes propose changes to any of these, including configuration settings and code. A CIP should provide a concise description and rationale for the change.

CIPs are the primary mechanism for proposing new features, for collecting input on an issue from the Global Synchronizer community, and for documenting the design and governance decisions that have gone into the Global Synchronizer. The CIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the CIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

Note that CIPs 0001 - 0042 were developed, proposed, and accepted or rejected before the CIP process was tracked in GitHub. As a result, this CIP GitHub repository records those early CIPs as PDF files, and also includes email discussions, among Super Validator rights owners, related to their approval. 


## Initiating a CIP

The CIP process begins with a new idea for the Global Synchronizer. Each potential CIP must have a champion -- someone who writes the CIP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the forum at [https://lists.sync.global/g/cip-discuss/topics (cip-discuss mailing list), and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The CIP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is CIP-able. Any member of the (cip-discuss mailing list) may champion a CIP. 
Small enhancements or patches to a particular piece of software often don't require standardisation across all Super Validators and Validators; these don't need a CIP and should be added in the relevant project-specific (e.g., Splice or Canton) development workflow with a patch submission to the applicable issue tracker.
Additionally, ideas for changing Global Synchronizer may be rejected for various reasons.
The first step should be to search past discussions to see if an idea has been considered before, and if so, what issues arose in its progression.
After investigating past work, the best way to proceed is by posting about the new idea to the cip-discuss mailing list.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a CIP is meant to save time for both the potential author and the wider community.
Asking the Global Synchronizer community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching history does not always do the trick).
It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most of the Global Synchronizer community.

Once the champion has asked the Global Synchronizer community whether an idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft CIP should be presented to the [https://lists.sync.global/g/cip-discuss/topics](cip-discuss mailing list).
This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft CIP, to make it properly formatted, of high quality, and to address additional concerns about the proposal.
Following a discussion, the proposal should be submitted to the [https://github.com/global-synchronizer-foundation/cips](cips git repository) as a pull request.
This draft must be written in CIP style as described below, and named with an alias such as "CIP-johndoe-A-Better-Global Synchronizer" until an editor has assigned it a CIP number (authors MUST NOT self-assign CIP numbers).

CIP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on both the initial idea and the CIP before submitting it for review. However, wherever possible, long, open-ended discussions on public mailing lists should be avoided. Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include: setting up a separate special-interest mailing list for the topic, having the CIP author accept private comments in the early design phases, setting up a wiki page or git repository, etc. CIP authors should use their discretion here.

It is highly recommended that a single CIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the CIP, the more successful it tends to be. If in doubt, split your CIP into several well-focused ones.

When the CIP draft is complete, a CIP editor will assign the CIP a number, label it as Standards Track, Governance, Tokenomics, Process or Informational, update the CIP Index, and merge the pull request to the cips git repository.
The CIP editors will not unreasonably reject a CIP.
Reasons for rejecting CIPs include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with Global Synchronizer policies or philosophy as previously defined.
For a CIP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria.
It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed change.
The change must represent a net improvement.
The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the code unduly.

The CIP author may update the draft as necessary in the cips git repository. Updates to drafts should also be submitted by the author as pull requests.

### Transferring CIP Ownership

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of CIPs to a new champion. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred CIP, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the CIP process, or is unreachable or not responding to email. A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the CIP. We try to build consensus around a CIP, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a competing CIP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a CIP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the CIP editors. If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the CIP editors will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :).

### CIP Editors

The current CIP editors are:

* [Stanislav German-Evtushenko](https://github.com/stas-sbi)
* [Taras Katrichenko](https://github.com/tkatrichenko)
* [Wayne Collier](https://github.com/isegall-da)
* [Itai Segall](https://github.com/waynecollier-da)

### CIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow

The CIP editors subscribe to the [https://lists.sync.global/g/cip-discuss/topics] mailing list.
Off-list CIP-related correspondence should be sent (or CC'd) to the CIP editors.

For each new CIP that comes in an editor does the following:

* Read the CIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be accepted.
* The title should accurately describe the content.
* The CIP draft must have been sent to the [https://lists.sync.global/g/cip-discuss/topics] mailing list for discussion.
* Motivation and backward compatibility (when applicable) must be addressed.
* For software, the defined Layer header must be correctly assigned for the given specification.
* Licensing terms must be acceptable for CIPs.

If the CIP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the CIP is ready for the repository it should be submitted as a "pull request" to the [https://github.com/global-synchronizer-foundation/cips](cips git repository) where it may get further feedback.

The CIP editor will:

* Assign a CIP number in the pull request.

* Merge the pull request when it is ready.


The CIP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The CIP editors monitor CIP changes, and update CIP headers as appropriate.

CIP editors may also, at their option, unilaterally make and merge strictly-editorial changes to CIPs, such as correcting misspellings, fixing broken links, etc.

## CIP format

CIPs should be written in markdown format.

Each CIP should have the following parts:

* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the CIP ([[#CIP header preamble|see below]]).

* Abstract -- A short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed.

* Specification -- The specification should describe the governance change, tokenomics change and impact, and/or the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow Super Validator node operators to determine whether a given implemnetation or on-chain vote proposal matches the specification. 

* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for CIPs that want to change the Global Synchronizer protocol. Changes to goverrnance or tokenonimcs should also provide a motivation. Motivations should clearly explain why the existing protocol is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves, or why existing governance or tokenomics are inadequate.

* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the proposal and why particular decisions were made. In the case of software designs, the rationale should describe alternate designs that were considered, and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

* Backwards compatibility -- All CIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.

* Reference implementation -- Required for changes to Daml models and the Canton protocol. This reference implementation must be completed before any Standards-track CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing code. The final implementation must include test code and documentation appropriate for the Global Synchronizer.

* Copyright -- The CIP must be explicitly licensed under acceptable copyright terms ([see below](#cip-licensing)). 

The template for these cips is located at [CIP-XXXX](/cip-XXXX).

### CIP header preamble

Each CIP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "*" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

<pre>
  CIP: <CIP number, or "?" before being assigned>
* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>
  Title: <CIP title; maximum 44 characters>
  Author: <list of authors' real names and email addrs>
* Discussions-To: <email address>
* Comments-Summary: <summary tone>
  Comments-URI: <links to wiki page for comments>
  Status: <Draft | Active | Proposed | Deferred | Rejected |
           Withdrawn | Final | Replaced | Obsolete>
  Type: <Standards Track | Governance | Tokenomics | Process | Informational>
  Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
  License: <abbreviation for approved license(s)>
* License-Code: <abbreviation for code under different approved license(s)>
* Post-History: <dates of postings to [https://lists.sync.global/g/cip-discuss] mailing list, or link to thread in mailing list archive>
* Requires: <CIP number(s)>
* Replaces: <CIP number>
* Superseded-By: <CIP number>
</pre>

The Layer header (only for Standards Track CIPs) documents which layer of the Global Synchronizer ecosystem the CIP applies to.
See [[CIP-00XX]] for definitions of the various layers. Activation of this CIP implies activation of CIP 00XX.

The Author header lists the names and email addresses of all the authors/owners of the CIP.
The format of the Author header value must be

  Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.

While a CIP is in private discussions (usually during the initial Draft phase), a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list or URL where the CIP is being discussed. No Discussions-To header is necessary if the CIP is being discussed privately with the author, or on the [https://lists.sync.global/g/cip-discuss] email mailing list.

The Type header specifies the type of CIP: Standards Track, Governance, Tokenomics, Process or Informational.

The Created header records the date that the CIP was assigned a number, while Post-History is used to record when new versions of the CIP are posted to the [https://lists.sync.global/g/cip-discuss] mailing list.
Dates should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.
Post-History is permitted to be a link to a specific thread in a mailing list archive.

CIPs may have a Requires header, indicating the CIP numbers that this CIP depends on.

CIPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that a CIP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the CIP that replaces the current document. The newer CIP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the CIP that it rendered obsolete.

### Auxiliary Files

CIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Auxiliary files should be included in a subdirectory for that CIP, or must be named CIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where "XXXX" is the CIP number, "Y" is a serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. "png").

## CIP types

There are five kinds of CIP:

* A Standards Track CIP describes any change that affects most or all Global Synchronizer implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Global Synchronizer. Standards Track CIPs consist of two parts, a design document and a reference implementation.

* A Governance CIP defines Super Validator rights owners and their weights, or modifies basic rules about governance of the Global Synchronizer, including the voting thresholds, // Simon Meier and Moritz Keifer to add detail here 

* A Tokenomics CIP modifies the reward structures for Super Validators, Validators, or Application Providers, alters fees for use of Canton Coin, or changes the target synchronizer fee for a single-step (pre-authorized) Canton Coin transaction. 

* A Process CIP describes a process related to the Global Synchronizer, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process CIPs are like Standards Track CIPs but apply to areas other than the Global Synchronizer protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to the Splice or Canton code bases. They often require community consensus, and unlike Informational CIPs, they are more than recommendations; users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the CIP process, and changes to the tools or environments used in Global Synchronizer deployment and operations. Any meta-CIP (a CIP about other CIPs) is also considered a Process CIP.

* An Informational CIP describes a Global Synchronizer design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Global Synchronizer community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational CIPs do not necessarily represent a Global Synchronizer community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational CIPs or follow their advice.

## CIP status field

### Specification


<img src="/images/CIP Flow diagrams.png"></img>

Champions of a CIP may decide on their own to change the status between Draft, Deferred, or Withdrawn.
A CIP editor may also change the status to Deferred when no progress is being made on the CIP.

A CIP may only change status from Draft (or Rejected) to Proposed, when the author deems it is complete, has a working implementation (where applicable), and has support from the community to recommend it to the Super Validator rights owners. 

CIPs should be changed from Draft or Proposed status, to Rejected status, upon request by any person, if the CIP has not made progress in three months. Such a CIP may be changed to Draft status if the champion provides revisions that meaningfully address public criticism of the proposal, or to Proposed status if it meets the criteria required as described in the previous paragraph.

#### CIP Approval

A Proposed CIP progresses to Approved status by vote of the Super Validator rights owners. An Approved CIP is ready to be ratified onchain. 

To request a vote, the author sends a message to the [https://lists.sync.global/g/cip-discuss/topics] (CIP Discuss) mailing list requesting a vote, and linking to the PR. A representative of the Global Synchronizer Foundation, or any representative of a Super Validator rights owner, forwards this request to the https://lists.sync.global/g/cip-vote/topics (CIP Votes) mailing list. This list has private membership but a public message architve, allowing the proposer to track progress. 

Designated representatives of the Super Validator rights owners cast their votes using (GitHub Team Voting). The set of designated representatives is maintained by Global Synchronizer Foundation staff. Approvals require a 2/3 majority vote in favor. Votes have a deadline for completion; Proposed CIPs that do not reach a majority in favor by this deadline move to Rejected status. 

Default deadlines for CIP votes are: 

Standards Track: Three (3) months after proposal
Governance: One (1) month after proposal
Tokenomics: One (1) month after proposal
Process: One (1) month after proposal
Informational: Two (2) weeks after proposal

The CIP proposer may recommend a shorter deadline, though in some cases this may cause the CIP to be rejected. 


#### Finalizing CIPs

An Approved CIP moves to Final status by being adopted on-chain by a 2/3 majority of Super Validators. This adoption process may differ for each CIP depending on the nature of its proposed changes. Evaluation of this status change should be objectively verifiable, and/or be discussed on the https://lists.sync.global/g/supervalidator-ops/topics (supervalidator operations) mailing list.

When a Final CIP is no longer relevant, its status may be changed to Replaced or Obsolete (which is equivalent to Replaced). This change must also be objectively verifiable and/or discussed. 

A Process or Informational CIP may change status from Draft to Active as soon as it is Approved by the Super Validator rights owners. 

##### Progression to Final status

When the vote to approve a CIP reaches conclusion, either in favor or by rejection, a member of the GSF staff announces the results in cip-announce@lists.sync.global/topics and also in cip-discuss@lists.sync.global/topics. The CIP proposer then links the announcement from cip-announce@lists.sync.global/topics to the PR, and merges the PR. 

PRs in Splice and Canton that implement further changes to code associated with Standards Track CIPs are tagged with the PR that introduced the CIP. 

On-chain implementation of CIPs requires action by Super Validator node operators, expressed by onchain votes.

Super Validator operators discuss and agree on a date for the proposed vote in the https://lists.sync.global/g/supervalidator-ops/topics (Super Validator Operations) maiiling list. A Super Validator operator then creates a vote proposal, with an expiration and an effectivity. The onchain vote proposal must include a link to the PR that introduced the Approved CIP. All Super Validators automatically report the result of onchain votes via the Canton Coin Scan API, and in the Canton Coin Scan UI hosted by each.


A hard-fork CIP requires adoption from the entire Global Synchronizer community. Adoption must be expressed by de facto usage of the hard-fork in practice (ie, not merely expressing public support, although that is a good step to establish agreement before adoption of the CIP). This adoption cannot be established merely by a super-majority, except by literally forcing the minority to accept the hard-fork (whether this is viable or not is outside the scope of this document). Super Validators will continue to support the prior version of the Global Synchronizer until there is broad agreement among Validator nodes that the prior version is no longer needed, because the new version meets the community's needs. (The Super Validators may increase the fees on the prior version of the Global Synchronizer to discourage its use.)

Peer services CIPs should be observed to be adopted by at least 1% of public listening nodes for one month.  // Do we have an equivalent to this on the Global Synchronizer? 

API/RPC and application layer CIPs must be implemented by at least two independent and compatible software applications before they may be considered Final.

Software authors are encouraged to publish summaries of what CIPs their software supports to aid in verification of status changes. 

These criteria are considered objective ways to observe the de facto adoption of the CIP, and are not to be used as reasons to oppose or reject a CIP. Should a CIP become actually and unambiguously adopted despite not meeting the criteria outlined here, it should still be updated to Final status.

### Rationale

The rationale for the Canton Improvement Proposal (CIP) process is grounded in fostering **trust, transparency, and collaboration** within the Global Synchronizer ecosystem. The foundation of the Global Synchronizer relies on consistent and reliable governance and operational frameworks, ensuring that all participants—whether Super Validators, Validators, or developers—can engage confidently in the network.

Decentralized systems thrive on shared trust, which emerges not from a single authority but from **collective understanding and agreement** among participants. Open and inclusive discussion is vital to maintaining this decentralized trust. The CIP process provides a structured platform where ideas can be proposed, debated, and refined in full view of the community, ensuring that decisions are informed by diverse perspectives and do not disproportionately benefit any one group.

A key pillar of this trust is the independence of the Global Synchronizer Foundation (GSF). To uphold its mission of **fairness and transparency**, the GSF operates independently of any single organization, individual, or entity. This independence ensures that the CIP process and the broader governance of the Global Synchronizer remain impartial, free from undue influence, and focused on the collective benefit of the community. By maintaining neutrality, the GSF reinforces the principles of decentralized governance and trust, providing a stable foundation for all participants to engage confidently.

In a decentralized ecosystem, trust is built through **transparent decision-making, communal understanding, and clear communication**, which reduce ambiguity and misalignment. By encouraging collaborative discourse, the CIP process strengthens this trust and ensures that all stakeholders have the opportunity to contribute to decisions that shape the network. Open discussions not only enhance mutual understanding but also demonstrate that decisions are grounded in principles of fairness and shared responsibility.

The Global Synchronizer operates as critical infrastructure for its participants, and its success depends on clarity, consensus, and confidence in how decisions are made. The CIP process creates a shared space where stakeholders can align on governance, technical specifications, and operational improvements. This communal understanding, coupled with the independence of the GSF, is essential to maintaining decentralized trust, ensuring that all changes are broadly supported and transparent in their motivations.

Ultimately, the CIP process fosters collaboration and innovation by creating a system of decentralized trust. It enables participants to engage in open dialogue, build consensus, and document decisions in a way that reinforces the principles of fairness, independence, and shared accountability that underpin the Global Synchronizer ecosystem.

## CIP comments

### Specification

Each CIP includes a comments page, as part of GitHub. 
Reviewers of the CIP who consider themselves qualified, should post their own comments on this page.
General discussion of the CIP that does not relate to the specific content of the PR should take place on the CIP Discuss [https://lists.sync.global/g/cip-discuss/topics] mailing list.

After some time, the CIP itself may be updated with a summary tones of the comments.
Summary tones may be chosen from the following, but this CIP does not intend to cover all possible nuances and other summaries may be used as needed:

* No comments yet.
* Unanimously Recommended for implementation
* Unanimously Discourage for implementation
* Mostly Recommended for implementation, with some Discouragement
* Mostly Discouraged for implementation, with some Recommendation

To avoid doubt: comments and status are unrelated metrics to judge a CIP, and neither should be directly influencing the other.

### Rationale

What is the purpose of CIP comments?

* Various CIPs have been adopted (the criteria required for "Final" Status) despite being considered generally inadvisable. Some presently regard CIPs as a "good idea" simply by virtue of them being assigned a CIP number. Due to the low barrier of entry for submission of new CIPs, it seems advisable for a way for reviewers to express their opinions on them in a way that is consumable to the public without needing to review the entire development discussion.

Will CIP comments be censored or limited to particular participants/"experts"?

* Participants should freely refrain from commenting outside of their area of knowledge or expertise. However, comments should not be censored, and participation should be open to the public.

## CIP licensing

### Specification

New CIPs may be accepted with the following licenses. Each new CIP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. The License header in the preamble must be placed after the Created header. Each license must be referenced by their respective abbreviation given below.

For example, a preamble might include the following License header:

    License: BSD-2-Clause
             GNU-All-Permissive

In this case, the CIP text is fully licensed under both the OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license as well as the GNU All-Permissive License, and anyone may modify and redistribute the text provided they comply with the terms of *either* license. In other words, the license list is an "OR choice", not an "AND also" requirement.

It is also possible to license source code differently from the CIP text. An optional License-Code header is placed after the License header. Again, each license must be referenced by their respective abbreviation given below.

For example, a preamble specifying the optional License-Code header might look like:

    License: BSD-2-Clause
             GNU-All-Permissive
    License-Code: GPL-2.0+

In this case, the code in the CIP is not available under the BSD or All-Permissive licenses, but only under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or newer.
If the code were to be available under *only* version 2 exactly, the "+" symbol should be removed from the license abbreviation.
For a later version (eg, GPL 3.0), you would increase the version number (and retain or remove the "+" depending on intent).

    License-Code: GPL-2.0   # This refers to GPL v2.0 *only*, no later license versions are acceptable.
    License-Code: GPL-2.0+  # This refers to GPL v2.0 *or later*.
    License-Code: GPL-3.0   # This refers to GPL v3.0 *only*, no later license versions are acceptable.
    License-Code: GPL-3.0+  # This refers to GPL v3.0 *or later*.

In the event that the licensing for the text or code is too complicated to express with a simple list of alternatives, the list should instead be replaced with the single term "Complex". In all cases, details of the licensing terms must be provided in the Copyright section of the CIP.

CIPs are not required to be *exclusively* licensed under approved terms, and may also be licensed under unacceptable licenses *in addition to* at least one acceptable license.
In this case, only the acceptable license(s) should be listed in the License and License-Code headers.

#### Recommended licenses

The default is:
* CC0-1.0: [https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal]

Also recommended is:
* Apache-2.0: [https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 Apache License, version 2.0]

In addition, it is recommended that literal code included in the CIP be dual-licensed under the same license terms as the project it modifies. For example, literal code intended for Global Synchronizer Core would ideally be dual-licensed under the MIT license terms as well as one of the above with the rest of the CIP text.

#### Not recommended, but acceptable licenses

* CC-BY-4.0: [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International]
* CC-BY-SA-4.0: [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International]
* MIT: [https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT Expat/MIT/X11 license]
* BSD-2-Clause: [https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license]
* BSD-3-Clause: [https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause OSI-approved BSD 3-clause license]
* BSL-1.0: [https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt Boost Software License, version 1.0]
* AGPL-3.0+: [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), version 3 or newer]
* FDL-1.3: [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.en.html GNU Free Documentation License, version 1.3]
* GPL-2.0+: [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or newer]
* LGPL-2.1+: [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 2.1 or newer]

#### Not acceptable licenses

All licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not acceptable terms for a Global Synchronizer Improvement Proposal unless a later CIP extends this one to add them.
However, CIPs predating the acceptance of this CIP were allowed under other terms, and should use these abbreviation when no other license is granted:

* OPL: [https://opencontent.org/openpub/ Open Publication License, version 1.0]
* PD: Released into the public domain

### Rationale

CIP 1 allowed the Open Publication License or releasing into the public domain; was this insufficient?

* The OPL is generally regarded as obsolete, and not a license suitable for new publications.
* Many are unfamiliar with the OPL terms, and may just prefer to use the public domain rather than license under uncertain terms.
* The OPL license terms allowed for the author to prevent publication and derived works, which was widely considered inappropriate for Global Synchronizer standards.
* Public domain is not universally recognised as a legitimate action, thus it is inadvisable.

Why are there software licenses included?

* Some CIPs, especially consensus layer, may include literal code in the CIP itself which may not be available under the exact license terms of the CIP.
* Despite this, not all software licenses would be acceptable for content included in CIPs.

Why is Public Domain no longer acceptable for new CIPs?

* In some jurisdictions, public domain is not recognised as a legitimate legal action, leaving the CIP simply copyrighted with no redistribution or modification allowed at all.
